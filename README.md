Simple and minimal web template using [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com/) for anyone who wants to create a personal website
without any hassle. Not the best mobile template but gets the job done.

Check out my [website](http://www.vareshmishra.com) for demo.

Don't forget to include your Fontawesome CDN script in the header.
You can get that from [here](http://fontawesome.io/get-started/).

Check out [AnimateCSS](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/). I've used it for animating social icons.
